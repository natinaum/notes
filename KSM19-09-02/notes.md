### S. 61 No. 2

1. It's easier to remember facts and points this way. If you write your text out you neither speak freely nor find anything on your cards. If you just have some points on your card (less than 5), you are able to read them in a blink of an eye.

2. You need an introduction for your presentation. In this part you could give the people a brief overview over the topic. In the main part you are able to deepen this overview and a final conclusion gives the possibility to shortly packs together was the slides were about and what you're views are.

3. Phrases which could be used to lead from one part to another.

4. Help to reinforce what one say. You could better show things with graphics and explain complicated themes when there is a graphical representation of what you are saying.

5. Slides should not have to much text and should have a high contrast. The text should be large enough and the design should be continuous. If it's is possible, one should use a fitting diagram instead of text.
